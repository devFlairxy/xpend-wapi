# Unique Wallet Generation Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of unique wallet generation for each deposit request, ensuring that wallets are never reused and are marked as "used" when deposits expire or complete.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Wallet Generation Service (`src/services/wallet.service.ts`)

**Previous Behavior:**
- System would reuse existing unused wallets for the same user/network
- Deterministic index generation could lead to address collisions

**New Behavior:**
- **Always generates a fresh, unique wallet for each deposit request**
- Uses timestamp-based unique index generation
- No wallet reuse - each request gets a completely new address

**Changes:**
```typescript
// REMOVED: Wallet reuse logic
// Check if wallet already exists for this user and network
// If wallet exists and is not used, return it

// ADDED: Always generate new wallets
// Always generate a new wallet for each deposit request (no reuse)
// This ensures better security and tracking for each deposit session

// REPLACED: generateIndexFromUserIdAndNetwork() 
// WITH: generateUniqueIndex() - includes timestamp and attempt number
```

### 2. Wallet Marking System

**Added New Methods:**
- `markWalletAsUsedById(walletId: string)` - Mark specific wallet by ID
- Enhanced `DatabaseService` with `markWalletAsUsedById()` method

**Why This Was Needed:**
- Since each wallet is now unique, we need to mark the specific wallet used in a deposit watch
- The old approach of finding "any unused wallet for user/network" is no longer appropriate

### 3. Deposit Watch Service (`src/services/deposit-watch.service.ts`)

**Enhanced Expiry Handling:**
```typescript
// ADDED: Mark wallet as used when watch expires
if (webhookSent) {
  // Update status to EXPIRED
  await this.prisma.depositWatch.update(/* ... */);
  
  // NEW: Mark the specific wallet as used
  await this.walletService.markWalletAsUsedById(watch.walletId);
  console.log(`ðŸ”’ Wallet marked as used due to expiry`);
}
```

**Enhanced Confirmation Handling:**
```typescript
// ADDED: Mark wallet as used when deposit confirms
if (webhookSent) {
  // Update status to CONFIRMED  
  await this.prisma.depositWatch.update(/* ... */);
  
  // NEW: Mark the specific wallet as used
  await this.walletService.markWalletAsUsedById(watch.walletId);
  console.log(`ðŸ”’ Wallet marked as used due to confirmed deposit`);
}
```

### 4. Database Schema Relationship

The implementation leverages the existing database relationship:
```prisma
model DepositWatch {
  walletId  String
  wallet    DisposableWallet @relation(fields: [walletId], references: [id])
  // ... other fields
}
```

This allows us to mark the exact wallet associated with each deposit watch.

## Behavioral Changes

### Before Implementation:
1. User requests deposit â†’ System checks for existing unused wallet
2. If unused wallet exists â†’ Return same wallet address
3. If deposit expires â†’ Wallet remains unused, can be reused
4. If deposit completes â†’ Mark any wallet for user/network as used

### After Implementation:
1. User requests deposit â†’ **System always generates new unique wallet**
2. **Each request gets completely fresh address**
3. If deposit expires â†’ **Mark the specific wallet as used (never reuse)**
4. If deposit completes â†’ **Mark the specific wallet as used**

## Security & Tracking Benefits

### Enhanced Security:
- **No address reuse** - Each deposit session gets a unique address
- **Better isolation** - Each transaction is completely independent
- **Reduced address collision risk** - Timestamp-based generation

### Improved Tracking:
- **One-to-one mapping** - Each deposit request maps to exactly one wallet
- **Clear audit trail** - Can track which wallet was used for which deposit
- **No ambiguity** - No confusion about which wallet handled which deposit

### Operational Benefits:
- **Simplified debugging** - Each deposit has its own unique address
- **Better user experience** - No confusion from address reuse
- **Cleaner database state** - Clear separation between deposit sessions

## Testing Verification

A test was created and successfully run to verify the implementation:

```bash
ðŸ§ª Testing unique wallet generation...
ðŸ”„ Generating 3 wallets for user test-user-123 on bsc...
âœ… Wallet 1: 0x9Ba37a36942Bb1e5831D48068cfd6f87BFD235a5
âœ… Wallet 2: 0xbdaB86f0EC6CB6A4fE4fFFda5771D1c7563E9b2B  
âœ… Wallet 3: 0x1a0fA5Ad124275535b877bDa107F4f830a417442

âœ… SUCCESS: All 3 wallets have unique addresses
âœ… New wallet generation behavior is working correctly
```

## Implementation Status

- âœ… **Unique wallet generation** - Implemented and tested
- âœ… **Wallet marking on expiry** - Implemented in deposit-watch service
- âœ… **Wallet marking on confirmation** - Implemented in deposit-watch service  
- âœ… **Database methods** - New `markWalletAsUsedById()` methods added
- âœ… **Build verification** - All changes compile successfully
- âœ… **Backward compatibility** - Legacy services unaffected

## Migration Notes

- **No database migration required** - Uses existing schema
- **Immediate effect** - All new deposit requests will get unique wallets
- **Legacy watches** - Existing active watches continue normally
- **No service downtime** - Changes are backward compatible

## Future Considerations

1. **Cleanup Strategy** - Consider implementing periodic cleanup of very old used wallets
2. **Monitoring** - Add metrics to track wallet generation and usage patterns
3. **Performance** - Monitor impact of generating more wallets vs. reusing them
4. **Analytics** - Track user deposit patterns with unique wallet data
