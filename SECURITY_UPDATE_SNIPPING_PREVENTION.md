# 🔒 Security Update: Snipping Attack Prevention

## 🚨 Vulnerability Identified

**Attack Scenario:**
1. User deposits $5 USDT → Gets credited $5
2. User quickly sends another $5 USDT before the first deposit is processed
3. **OLD SYSTEM:** Would see $10 total balance and credit $10 (double credit!)
4. **Result:** User gets $15 credit for $10 deposit (5$ profit from attack)

## 🛡️ Security Fixes Implemented

### 1. **Transaction-Based Detection** (Replaces Balance-Based)
- **Before:** Compare current balance vs previous balance
- **After:** Scan individual Transfer events and process each transaction separately
- **Benefit:** Each deposit is processed atomically, preventing double counting

### 2. **Transaction Hash Uniqueness**
- Each transaction hash (`txId`) is processed only once
- Database constraint prevents duplicate transaction processing
- Complete audit trail of all processed transactions

### 3. **Block Scanning with Tracking**
- Added `lastScannedBlock` field to track scanning progress
- Prevents re-processing of old blocks
- Efficient scanning from last known position

### 4. **Individual Transaction Processing**
- Each Transfer event is processed independently
- Amount validation per transaction
- No balance aggregation vulnerabilities

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Database Schema Updates
```sql
-- Added to DepositWatch model
lastScannedBlock  Int?     -- Last block number scanned for transaction-based detection
token             String   -- Specific token to watch for (USDT, BUSD, etc.)
```

### Updated Deposit Detection Logic
```typescript
// OLD: Balance-based (vulnerable)
const balance = await contract.balanceOf(walletAddress);
const depositAmount = balance - lastKnownBalance;

// NEW: Transaction-based (secure)
const events = await contract.queryFilter(transferFilter, lastScannedBlock, currentBlock);
for (const event of events) {
  // Process each transaction individually
  const depositAmount = parseFloat(ethers.formatUnits(event.args.value, decimals));
  // Check for duplicates and process
}
```

### Security Features
1. **Transaction Hash Tracking:** Each `txId` processed only once
2. **Block Scanning:** Prevents re-processing of old blocks
3. **Individual Processing:** Each deposit processed separately
4. **Database Constraints:** Unique constraints prevent duplicates
5. **Amount Validation:** Only exact expected amounts processed

## 📊 Attack Prevention Comparison

### OLD SYSTEM (Vulnerable)
```
Balance: $0 → $5 → $10
Detection: $10 - $0 = $10 (WRONG! Double credit)
Result: User gets $15 credit for $10 deposit
```

### NEW SYSTEM (Secure)
```
Transaction 1: $5 USDT (tx_hash_1) → Credit $5
Transaction 2: $5 USDT (tx_hash_2) → Credit $5
Result: User gets $10 credit for $10 deposit (CORRECT!)
```

## 🚨 Security Benefits
